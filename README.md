# German numberconverter
### This program converts numbers under 1000000000 to text.

#### I used [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) for testing.

Known issues to fix:
- [ ] numbers under 1000000000 but with decimals more than 10 digits give `false`
- [ ] numbers with an other character than number inside don't give `false`
- [ ] numbers under 1000000000 but with "0"-s before the number, more than 10 digits give `false`
